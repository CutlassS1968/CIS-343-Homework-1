What is a vector in Computer Science?

    Vector containers are implemented as dynamic arrays; Just as regular arrays, vector containers have their elements 
    stored in contiguous storage locations, which means that their elements can be accessed not only using iterators 
    but also using offsets on regular pointers to elements.

    But unlike regular arrays, storage in vectors is handled automatically, allowing 
    it to be expanded and contracted as needed.
